#The GET Method - GET is used to request data from a specified resource. 
# When you access a websiteâ€™s page, your browser makes a get request to your 
# API and your API is returning the front-end that is displayed in the browser. 
# All the APIs that you create in Flask, by default, use GET Request.
#  If you start your hello_world server and go to localhost:5000, you can see 
# in your terminal that the browser made a GET request on the server/API.

#The POST Method - POST is used to send data to the server to create/update
#a resource. A user wants to sign up from the signup page? A user wants to
#change their password? That would be a post request.

#The PUT Method - PUT is used to send data to a server to create / update a 
# resource. The basic difference between PUT and POST is that a POST request 
# is when you can create multiple copies of the same resource. A PUT request, 
# on the other hand means that you want to create only one copy of the resource, 
# i.e. Signing Up a unique user.

#The DELETE Method - DELETE is used to delete a resource.
#The default method used by flask is GET.
